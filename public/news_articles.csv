"Assured autonomy: What, from where, how, and what next?","medium.com • Aug 2023","/news1.png","https://medium.com/purdue-engineering/assured-autonomy-what-from-where-how-and-what-next-661a5d521b58","Assured autonomy is rapidly gaining traction in U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) circles. The term broadly relates to how to put security into autonomous operations. Assurance will encourage people to adopt autonomous systems, and reduce societal harm from insecure autonomous systems. Read about how the experts at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and the ARL-funded Assured Autonomy Innovation Institute (A212) at Purdue discuss assured autonomy, its current state, what the institute is doing, and what the future holds."
"ARL personnel play a leading role in the Grand Challenges in Resilience Workshop organized at Purdue November 13-15. ARL Branch Chief, Dr. Priya Narayanan, addressed the audience and ARL researcher, Dr. Peng Wang, judged the student poster competition.","purdue.edu • Nov 2023","/news2.jpg","https://engineering.purdue.edu/grandchallenges","Our society is crucially dependent on several interdependent critical infrastructure systems and processes for operating these systems, such as, industrial control systems, IoT systems underlying our smart cities, large-scale cyber systems, and built environments like transportation and building infrastructures. These are subjected to various kinds of hazards and faults, both natural and malicious, often leading to user-visible failures. The technical communities supported by NSF's CISE and Engineering Directorates have developed scientific methods to analyze the failure modes of the infrastructures and provide engineering tools to systematically build in resilience. This workshop is meant to bring together members of these communities who have focused on resilient and adaptive cyber-infrastructures, resilient cyber-physical systems, and scientific foundations of resilient socio-technical systems."
"A2I2 researchers from Purdue and ARL lead a vision paper on game theory and distributed systems security to appear in IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine.","arxiv.org • Jun 2024","/gametheory-distsystems-vision.jpg","https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01281","Many of our critical infrastructure systems and personal computing systems have a distributed computing systems structure. The incentives to attack them have been growing rapidly as has their attack surface due to increasing levels of connectedness. Therefore, we feel it is time to bring in rigorous reasoning to secure such systems. The distributed system security and the game theory technical communities can come together to effectively address this challenge. In this article, we lay out the foundations from each that we can build upon to achieve our goals. Next, we describe a set of research challenges for the community, organized into three categories -- analytical, systems, and integration challenges, each with "short term" time horizon (2-3 years) and "long term" (5-10 years) items. This article was conceived of through a community discussion at the 2022 NSF SaTC PI meeting."
"Reinforcement Learning for Mission Planning paper accepted to appear in the Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation","arxiv.org • Jun 2024","/RL_mission_planning.png","https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01693","Given the recent impact of Deep Reinforcement Learning in training agents to win complex games like StarCraft and DoTA(Defense Of The Ancients) - there has been a surge in research for exploiting learning based techniques for professional wargaming, battlefield simulation and modeling. Real time strategy games and simulators have become a valuable resource for operational planning and military research. However, recent work has shown that such learning based approaches are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of an agent trained for a Command and Control task in an environment that is controlled by an active adversary. The C2 agent is trained on custom StarCraft II maps using the state of the art RL algorithms - A3C and PPO. We empirically show that an agent trained using these algorithms is highly susceptible to noise injected by the adversary and investigate the effects these perturbations have on the performance of the trained agent. Our work highlights the urgent need to develop more robust training algorithms especially for critical arenas like the battlefield."
"Purdue Professors Lead New NSF CHORUS Center on Resilience in Cyber Physical Systems","choruscomputes.xyz • Aug 2024","/chorus_team_pic.jpg","https://www.choruscomputes.xyz.","A team of researchers received an NSF Center award for the establishment of the CHORUS Center. This center focuses on enhancing the resilience of large-scale Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with the application domain of Connected and Autonomous Transportation Systems. Professor Saurabh Bagchi, the Director of the A2I2 Institute, serves as the CHORUS Center Director. Key Principal Investigators include Professor Somali Chaterji from Purdue University and Professor Yin Li from the University of Wisconsin."
